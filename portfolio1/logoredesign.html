            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p>

              I decided to focus on small local businesses and chose Fancy Fresh Food Shop for this project. Given that
              their name is quite long, I had to be thoughtful about how to incorporate it into the logo design. I drew
              inspiration from elements found within the shop, such as blenders, fruits, and vegetables, while keeping
              the design modern and simplified for a clean, streamlined look.

            <h3>Pineapple Top</h3>
            <p>
              I chose the top of a pineapple as the main element of the logo because it's a widely recognized tropical
              fruit and one of many key ingredients in Fancy Fresh Food Shop's drinks. The top view of a pineapple is
              not only visually striking but also naturally symmetrical, making it an ideal shape for a clean and modern
              logo. Its unique form adds a sense of freshness and energy while still reflecting the vibrant, natural
              ingredients used by the shop.

            <p>option 2:</p>
            <h3>Blender</h3>
            <p>
              I drew inspiration from the aerial view of a blender, a staple tool in Fancy Fresh Food Shop's daily
              operations. From above, the blender's blades create a dynamic and recognizable shape that represents
              motion, energy, and freshness—qualities that reflect the brand's identity. This perspective also allowed
              me to simplify the form into a modern, abstract symbol while still connecting it directly to the shop's
              focus on blended drinks and healthy ingredients.

            <p>option 3:</p>
            <h3>Bok Choy (Rose)</h3>
            <p>
              I found inspiration in the base of a bok choy—when sliced, it reveals a beautiful, rose-like pattern, one
              of nature's unexpected and stunning designs. Its natural form not only connects directly to the shop's
              fresh,
              plant-based ingredients but also adds an element of elegance and organic beauty to the logo. By
              highlighting this detail, I was able to create a design that feels both intentional and uniquely tied to
              the brand.

              I chose the top of a pineapple as a key element in the logo because of its unique and instantly
              recognizable shape. Unlike the common side view, the top view offers a fresh perspective that feels
              modern, symmetrical, and visually dynamic. The pineapple itself is one of the most popular tropical fruits
              and a signature ingredient in many of Fancy Fresh Food Shop's drinks, making it a meaningful
              representation of the brand. Its spiky, crown-like leaves also add a sense of energy and freshness, while
              symbolizing hospitality and warmth—qualities that align with the shop's inviting atmosphere and
              community-focused values. This design choice helped me create a logo that feels bold, clean, and rooted in
              the essence of the business.
